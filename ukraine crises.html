	<p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: Text new roman; color: white;">
	The war in Ukraine not only transformed European security policy -- it also has global effects that can bring about new security threats. Whilst we support Ukraine and tackle a humanitarian crisis in Europe, the wider consequences of the war must be noted, too.<br><br>The war in Ukraine has raised the prices of food and fuel, which undermines food security in developing countries, already weakened by the pandemic and climate crisis. The food crisis also has an immense impact on education. Longstanding positive progress is about to grind to a halt and extreme poverty is on the rise again. An increasing number of countries are threatened by a prolonged and deepening crisis.

	<h2 style="color: white;"><u>Economic difficulties</u></h2>
	<p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: Text new roman;color: white;">Ukraine’s postindependence economic performance—in sharp contrast to its relatively successful efforts at state building and diplomacy—was markedly poor. The social dislocation brought about by economic “shock therapy” in Russia dampened the Ukrainian government’s desire for rapid change; it opted instead for a gradualist approach toward achieving a mixed economy. Economic decline followed, since Ukrainian industry was already suffering from the disruption of trade with former Soviet republics in the wake of the U.S.S.R.’s demise. Ukraine’s heavy dependence on foreign energy sources also strained the economy, particularly because Russia, Ukraine’s main supplier, moved to raise the previously subsidized price of fossil fuels to world levels. As a solid monetary policy had not been established, Ukraine experienced hyperinflation, which reached a rate of at least 4,735 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, corruption increased as political insiders grabbed state assets for themselves or took unfair advantage of low-interest loans available to industry and agriculture. A sustained attempt at economic reform came with the appointment of Leonid Kuchma as prime minister in October 1992. His efforts, however, were strongly opposed by a majority of parliamentarians and, to a degree,undermined by President Kravchuk himself. An exasperated Kuchma resigned in 1993.</p>
