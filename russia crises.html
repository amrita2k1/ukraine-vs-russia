<h2>How will the Russia Ukraine war affect Russia’s Economy?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px; font-style: Text new roman;">If you think this war is only going to affect the USA, UK, India, and other nationals, you are wrong. The most hard-hit countries will be Russia and Ukraine itself. How? Let’s see.

You would have heard about the sanctions made towards Russia. Yes, that’s the reason it will see the most adverse effect of the war it started. The biggest sanction ramped is against the Central Bank of Russia [CBR], which will play a crucial role in its domestic foreign exchange market.

Freezing the CBR’s assets and accounts in the G7 countries means that it is left with gold reserves and renminbi reserves worth $127bn and $70bn in Russia respectively. However, they are useless to keep the domestic foreign exchange market rate stable.

The selling rate of dollars in banks’ exchange offices had risen by at least 45 percent as compared to the Friday, on the day of declaration. The devaluation of the rouble will increase consumer inflation by 4 to 5%. How? 

As it will create problems in imports and uncertainty in the market. That will again undermine the business’s desire to take risks and there will be lower supply and higher food prices. The devaluation of the rouble will create disruptions in the payment system which will lead to disruptions in the supply of imported goods to Russia. And altogether will push the inflation higher.

The sanctions on CBR by western countries will also affect the SWIFT bank and foreign debts. Apart from that, the sanctions are levied on technology and Aviation as well. Upon request, Apple Inc. has also declared that it will stop selling its products in Russia. The 40% of aircraft in the Russian fleet are European-made Airbus, which carries 41% of their passengers. Hence, the sanctions will affect the aviation industry as well.</p>
