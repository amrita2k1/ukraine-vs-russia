<p >Being a developing nation, India will certainly have an adverse effect on its economy, due to fluctuation in the global economy. Also, it has hurt the sentiments of many by abstaining from the NATO votings. So, let’s see the effect of the Russia Ukraine war on the economy of India.

Due to sanctions rammed on Russia, the Indian and Russian trade is also facing issues. The sanction imposed by Europe will affect the regular trade of Tea between India and Russia. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raised the prices of crude oil and it will stay the same till mid-term, i.e, $100 per barrel.

India imports 85% of the crude oil used in the country. The prices of oil won’t be affected due to sanctions as the Indian supply route is from the Middle East, Africa, and North America, which still remain untouched by the conflicts. They will continue to supply the gas and oil as normal. However, the prices will be affected due to the inflation posed by the war.</p>

<h2 >How will the Russia Ukraine war affect the US economy?</h2>
<p>Not only the US economy, but the war between Russia and Ukraine will affect the global economy as well. The reason behind that is they are the exporters of oil, natural gas, and other industrial commodities. Let’s see the price changes in the following commodities in the USA.

The gas prices are soaring high after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is estimated that it will reach the national high average pricing of $4 per gallon by Monday (7th March 2022). The same is with crude oil prices, currently, it is $106 per barrel and it is expected to hike up to $120 per barrel. The last time prices went this high was Hurricane Katrina.

Apart from gas and oil, Russia and Ukraine both are heavy exporters of Wheat. Besides that, it also produces low-cost and high-quality fertilizers, hence farmers are expecting a hike in fertilizers as well.

All in all this Russia Ukraine war is going to affect both the nation and its citizens. Politicians stated they are happy to pay the price of supporting Ukraine. The USA government is going to suffer most, as they along with Europe have sanctioned Russia for so many things as soon as it declared war against Ukraine.</p>
